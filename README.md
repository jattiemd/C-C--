# Mini C++ Guessing Games Program 

This is a project coded in C++ that I put together in my first year of university. The program houses 3 mini guessing games - Higher or Lower, Rock Paper Scissors, Hidden fingers.

- Higher or Lower: In this game the computer outputs a number and then outputs a second hidden number. It then asks the user to guess whether the second number is higher or lower than the first number.
- Rock, Paper Scissors: In this game the user battles the computer selects a weapon (rock, paper or scissors) and asks the user to do the same. Thereafter, the best weapon wins the match.
- Hidden Fingers: In this game the computer hides a number of fingers, no more than five. the user then has to guess the number of fingers that has been hidden.
